<p>In the beginning of May, I used <a href="https://jlaw.netlify.app/2021/05/03/scraping-google-play-reviews-with-rselenium/"><code>RSelenium</code> to scrape the Google Play Store reviews</a> for Instagram Lite to demonstrate how the package can be used to automate browser behavior. Its taken longer than I had initially planned to do this follow-up on the analysis of that data. But better late than never. So in this analysis I will do some exploratory work and some text mining to look at questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How have IG Lite reviews been trending?</li>
<li>What are prevalent topics in the Google Play reviews about IGLite?</li>
<li>For words with negative sentiment, why are people feeling negatively?</li>
<li>What are the most prevalent keywords in the set of reviews?</li>
</ul>
<p>The main libraries that I will use to do this analysis are <code>udpipe</code> for applying the language model used to develop part of speech tagging, <code>BTM</code> to construct the Biterm model, and <code>textrank</code> / <code>wordcloud</code> to do keyword extraction and make the wordcloud. Both <code>udpipe</code>, <code>BTM</code>, and <code>textrank</code> are part of the <a href="http://www.bnosac.de">Bnosac</a> NLP ecosystem.</p>
<p>The analyses from these posts are heavily inspired from Bnosac’s posts on <a href="http://www.bnosac.be/index.php/blog/98-biterm-topic-modelling-for-short-texts">Biterm Modeling</a> and <a href="http://www.bnosac.be/index.php/blog/85-you-did-a-sentiment-analysis-with-tidytext-but-you-forgot-to-do-dependency-parsing-to-answer-why-is-something-positive-negative">Sentiment Analysis</a>.</p>

<p>For data I’ll be using the result file from the my <a href="https://jlaw.netlify.app/2021/05/03/scraping-google-play-reviews-with-rselenium/">web scraping post</a> from April:</p>

<td align="left">Its surely consumes less data than original app, but many of you may not get comfortable with this interface. One of the major problems I faced was that stories are getting replayed many times without me doing anything. The next major issue is that if you dont like a post it comes to your feed everytime over and over again until you like the post. Hope Instgram Team will find a solution to these problems</td>

What’s the problem - The feeds never get refreshed . You just have to scroll down and when you click refresh still you see the same feeds. Doesn’t support links . Lags too much . Too much annoying while using the messenger. Despite having a good internet connection it keeps laging saying something went wrong. It’s too slow</td>

<h2>Exploring the IG Lite Review Data</h2>
<p>Given the time the initial analysis was run I captured 2,040 reviews covering dates from 2019-03-03 and 2021-04-24. However, reviews from earlier than December 2020 are likely referring to the initial version of IG Lite rather than the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-launches-new-instagram-lite-app-in-india-global-rollout-to-follow-later/">relaunched version</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing to look at is to see how the review counts have been trending over time:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>iglite %&gt;% 
  count(dates, name = &quot;reviews&quot;) %&gt;%
  filter(dates &gt;= lubridate::ymd(20201201)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = dates, y = reviews)) + 
    geom_line() + 
    geom_smooth(se = F, lty = 2) + 
    labs(y = &quot;# of Reviews in data set&quot;, x = &quot;Month&quot;,
         title = &quot;Number of IGLite Reviews In Dataset&quot;) + 
    cowplot::theme_cowplot() +
    theme(
      plot.title.position = &#39;plot&#39;,
      text = element_text(family = &#39;Arial Narrow&#39;)
    )</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/review_count-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The trend of reviews started strong in mid-December upon the launch of IG Lite before stabilizing at around 10 per day before beginning an incline in February and reaching around 20 reviews per day. So if we assume that increasing reviews are correlated with increasing users then it seems like IG Lite is gaining momentum.</p>
<p>But are the reviews good reviews? As an app that is continuously iterating it would be interesting to see how the distribution of Star Ratings from 1-5 to changed over time as more reviews come in. To do this we can look at the cumulative distributions for each star rating from Dec 2020 through April 2021.</p>
<p>Since certain days do not have coverage across all 5 reviews (remember we’ll only getting 10 per day at the beginning). I’ll need to create a skeleton for each day and all five ratings so that zeros are taken into account rather than treated as gaps. For this I’ll using tidyr’s <code>crossing()</code> function, which is a bit like <code>expand.grid()</code> in Base R to create a data set with all combinations of vectors.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Create a data frame with every day from 12/1/2020 through the max date and  1-5 
#value for stars on each day
tidyr::crossing(
  dates = seq.Date(ymd(20201201), max(iglite$dates), by = &#39;day&#39;),
  stars = 1:5
  ) %&gt;% 
  # Join  actual data to the skeleton to get the number of reviews for that day
  left_join(
    iglite %&gt;%
      count(dates, stars, name = &quot;reviews&quot;) %&gt;%
      filter(dates &gt;= lubridate::ymd(20201201)),
    by = c(&quot;dates&quot;, &quot;stars&quot;)
  ) %&gt;% 
  # Fill any missing values with 0
  replace_na(list(reviews = 0)) %&gt;%
  # Create the cumulative count of reviews for each star level
  group_by(stars) %&gt;%
  arrange(dates) %&gt;% 
  mutate(cuml_stars = cumsum(reviews)) %&gt;%
  ungroup() %&gt;% 
  # Add a column for the cumulative count of reviews for up to that point
  add_count(dates, wt = cuml_stars, name = &quot;total_review_in_date&quot;) %&gt;%
  # Create the cumulative distribution for that star level to that point
  # For the most recent day create a label to be used in the post
  mutate(pct = cuml_stars / total_review_in_date,
         lbl = if_else(dates == max(dates), 
                       paste(stars, pct %&gt;% percent(accuracy = 1), sep = &#39;: &#39;), 
                       NA_character_)) %&gt;% 
  # Remove the dates prior to having 25 total reviews
  filter(total_review_in_date &gt;= 25) %&gt;% 
  # Plot the distribution
  ggplot(aes(x = dates, y = pct, color = as.factor(stars))) + 
    geom_line() + 
    ggrepel::geom_label_repel(aes(label = lbl)) + 
    scale_color_discrete(guide = F) + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) + 
    labs(title = &quot;IGLite Rating Distribution&quot;,
         subtitle = &quot;Cumulative Distribution Dec - Apr&quot;,
         caption = &quot;Dates Start at 25 Reviews&quot;) + 
    cowplot::theme_cowplot() + 
    theme(
      plot.title.position = &#39;plot&#39;,
      text = element_text(family = &#39;Arial Narrow&#39;)
    )</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/cumulative%20ratings-1.png" width="672" />
Looking at the distributions over time, in January one and three star ratings were the most common with around 25% each. Fives and twos were relatively low. However, since January, the number of fives have climbed to eventually make up 23% of the total reviews in the data set. Unfortunately, the number of one star reviews has also climbed and is the most common review in the data set at 31%.</p>
<p>An alternative way of utilizing the star ratings is to create a Net Promoter-like score. If you’ve ever received an email asking “On a scale from 1 to 10 how likely are you to recommend this to a friend”, you’ve been a part of the Net Promoter Score. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter">The Net Promoter Score is a score from -100 to 100 that is an index about how willing people are to reccomend a product</a>. It divides the world into Promoters (scores 9 and 10) and Detractors (scores 6 and below) and then calculates % of Promoters - % of Detractors.</p>
<p>In this case, I’ll consider a promoter as someone who rates IGLite a 4 or a 5 and a detractor someone who rates IGLite a 1 or a 2. Then we can calculate our version of NPS for each month to get a rough look at sentiment trend.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>iglite %&gt;%
  # Filter to December
  filter(dates &gt;= lubridate::ymd(20201201)) %&gt;% 
  # Turn star scores into Promoter / Detractors and create a dataset where
  # for each day we&#39;ll have Favorable/Unfavorable/Neutral as columns
  mutate(lbl = case_when(
    stars &gt;= 4 ~ &quot;favorable&quot;,
    stars &lt;= 2 ~ &quot;unfavorable&quot;,
    TRUE ~ &quot;neutral&quot;
    ),
    mth = format(dates, &quot;%Y-%m&quot;)
  ) %&gt;% 
  count(mth, lbl, name = &quot;reviews&quot;) %&gt;%
  spread(lbl, reviews) %&gt;% 
  replace_na(list(favorable = 0, unfavorable = 0, neutral = 0)) %&gt;% 
  # Calculate the NPS score
  mutate(
         total = favorable + neutral + unfavorable,
         pct_favorable = favorable/total,
         pct_unfavorable = unfavorable/total,
         nps = pct_favorable - pct_unfavorable
         ) %&gt;%
  # Plot the NPS score by month
  ggplot(aes(x = mth, y = nps), group = 1) + 
    geom_col(aes(fill = if_else(nps &lt; 0, &#39;darkred&#39;, &#39;darkgreen&#39;))) + 
    geom_point() + 
    geom_label(aes(label = nps %&gt;% percent(accuracy = .1))) + 
    scale_fill_discrete(guide = F) + 
    labs(title = &quot;NPS Score for IGLite&quot;,
         subtitle = &quot;NPS = % Promoters (Reviews &gt; 3) - % Detractors (Reviews &lt; 3)&quot;,
         y = &quot;Net Promoter Score&quot;,
         x = &quot;Month&quot;) + 
   cowplot::theme_cowplot() + 
    theme(
      plot.title.position = &#39;plot&#39;,
      text = element_text(family = &#39;Arial Narrow&#39;),
      axis.text.y = element_blank(),
      axis.ticks.y = element_blank()
    )</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/nps-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Yikes! This does not look great with each of the 5 months in the data having a negative NPS score. However, similar to the cumulative ratings in the chart above the later months (March and April) have faired much better than the first two months post-release (Jan and Feb) with the NPS score being close to zero. Looking at the raw data, it seems like the “neutral” comes from being polarizing with 42% Promoters and 43% Detractors rather than having a lot of people with neutral with 3 star ratings:</p>

<h2>Text-Mining</h2>
<p>With the EDA portion done, its on to Text Mining the reviews. In a past-post I had used <a href="https://jlaw.netlify.app/2020/08/02/what-s-the-difference-between-instagram-and-tiktok-using-word-embeddings-to-find-out/">the Tidytext Ecosystem to look at Tweet difference between Instagram and TikTok</a> but this time I will be using the <a href="http://www.bnosac.be">Bnosac</a> ecosystem of packages to do Biterm Modeling, Sentiment Analysis with dependency parsing, and then the <code>textrank</code> and <code>wordcloud</code> package to generate a word-cloud of extracted keywords.</p>
<div id="pre-processing-with-udpipe" class="section level3">
<h3>Pre-processing with udpipe</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://jlaw.netlify.app/2020/10/07/looking-for-media-bias-in-coverage-of-trump-s-covid-diagnosis/">prior text-mining posts</a>, I used tidytext to handle tokenization, however, in this analysis I will leverage the <code>udpipe</code> package. The <code>udpipe</code> is a R wrapper around the C++ library of the same name that uses a pre-trained language models to <a href="https://bnosac.github.io/udpipe/docs/doc1.html">easily tokenize, tag, lemmatize or perform dependency parsing on text in any language</a>. The “ud” in udpipe stands for Universal Dependencies which is a “<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/#ud-treebanks">framework for consistent annotation of grammar</a>”.</p>
<p>In order to prepare the data for the model there needs to be some light pre-processing as <code>udpipe</code> expects the data to have a <code>doc_id</code> and a <code>text</code> field.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Columns need to be doc_id and text for the model
cleaned &lt;- iglite %&gt;% 
  mutate(doc_id = row_number(),
         text = str_to_lower(reviews),
         text = str_replace_all(text, &quot;&#39;&quot;, &quot;&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>To annotate our data with <code>udpipe</code> I’ll call the <code>udpipe()</code> function with my data and the language of the model to use. This function is will download the appropriate language model, in this case English, and then annotate the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>annotated_reviews    &lt;- udpipe(cleaned, &quot;english&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>To show what the <code>udpipe</code> model did to the data we can look at the first review before the annotations:</p>

<p>We now get a ton of metadata including indicators for the sentence, we can the token (<code>token</code>) and its lemma (<code>lemma</code>) (note that consumes becomes consume), parts of speech (<code>upos</code>), and dependency relationships (<code>deprel</code>) and more.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve tokenized the data we can start using it to analyze the reviews.</p>
</div>
<div id="biterm-modeling" class="section level3">
<h3>Biterm Modeling</h3>
<p>The first analysis task will be biterm modeling using the <code>BTM</code> package. The Biterm Topic Model model was developed by <a href="https://github.com/xiaohuiyan/xiaohuiyan.github.io/blob/master/paper/BTM-WWW13.pdf">Yan et. al</a> as a means to determining the topics that occur in short-texts such as Tweets (or in this case Google Play Reviews). Its meant to provide an improvement to traditional topics modeling in uses cases such as this. My understanding of the difference between traditional topic modeling and biterm topic model is that in the former, the model learns word co-occurrence within documents, while with the later, the model learns word co-occurrences within a window across the entire set of documents. In this context a “biterm” <a href="https://github.com/bnosac/BTM">consists of two words co-occurring in the same context, for example, in the same short text window</a>. This analysis is modeled after the one from <a href="http://www.bnosac.be/index.php/blog/98-biterm-topic-modelling-for-short-texts">bnosac</a>.</p>
<p>In the BTM model we can explicitly tell the model which word co-occurrences we care about vs. letting it run on everything. This enables us to only care about certain parts of speech, words of certain lengths, and non-stop words. For this analysis we will consider a co-occurrence window of 3 while removing stopwords, removing words with less than 3 characters, and only keeping nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Define a Dictionary of BiTerms
library(data.table)
library(stopwords)
biterms &lt;- as.data.table(annotated_reviews)
biterms &lt;- biterms[, cooccurrence(x = lemma,
                                  relevant = upos %in% c(&quot;NOUN&quot;, &quot;ADJ&quot;, &quot;VERB&quot;) &amp; 
                                             nchar(lemma) &gt; 2 &amp; !lemma %in% stopwords(&quot;en&quot;),
                                  skipgram = 3),
                   by = list(doc_id)]</code></pre>

<p>This states that in the first review, the word pair (like, post) occurs within a 3 word window twice in the document.</p>
<p>Now we can actually construct the biterm model. For simplicity, I’m setting it to train 9 topics. The background = T setting makes the 1st topic a background topic that reflects to empirical word distribution to filter out common words (which is why k = 10):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(123456)

train_data &lt;- annotated_reviews %&gt;% 
  filter(
    upos %in% c(&quot;NOUN&quot;, &quot;ADJ&quot;, &quot;VERB&quot;),
    !lemma %in% stopwords::stopwords(&quot;en&quot;),
     nchar(lemma) &gt; 2
  ) %&gt;%
  select(doc_id, lemma)

btm_model     &lt;- BTM(train_data, biterms = biterms, k = 10, iter = 2000, background = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Now that we’ve constructed topics, there needs to be a good way to visualize those topics. Fortunately the <code>textplot</code> package handles this nicely:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(textplot)
library(ggraph)
set.seed(123456)

plot(btm_model, top_n = 10,
     title = &quot;BTM model of IGLite Reviews&quot;,
     labels = c(&quot;&quot;,
                &quot;Reels&quot;,
                &quot;Likes the App&quot;,
                &quot;Takes Too Long&quot;,
                &quot;Can&#39;t Upload&quot;,
                &quot;Dark Mode&quot;, 
                &quot;Bugs&quot;, 
                &quot;Feature Requests&quot;,
                &quot;Uses Less Resources&quot;, 
                &quot;Instagram Lite&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/BTM_Vis-1.png" width="864" />
From this chart we can see that there’s a lot of people mentioning bugs and other problems, specifically around upload. People talking about how IG Lite consumes less space and data, people wanting new features such as a music sticker option in stories, and a LOT of people wanting Dark Mode. And there are people who like it and think its a good app.</p>

<h3>Sentiment Analysis withe Dependency Parsing</h3>
<p>In many sentiment analyses a dictionary method is used to assign positive sentiment and negative sentiment and then some sort of aggregation occurs to determine whether a document is “happy” or “sad” or whatever other type of emotion. But what gets left on the table is “Why” there is positive or negative sentiment. In this case, we can see that people gave IG Lite bad ratings or complained about issues, but without looking through every review, it tough to know why.</p>
<p>This next piece is based on a <a href="http://www.bnosac.be/index.php/blog/85-you-did-a-sentiment-analysis-with-tidytext-but-you-forgot-to-do-dependency-parsing-to-answer-why-is-something-positive-negative">bnosac blog post</a> and will leverage the dependency output from <code>udpipe</code> to see what words are connected to the words with negative sentiment.</p>
<p>To first determine words with negative sentiment I will need an external dictionaries to identify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive vs. Negative words - the base positive vs. negative scoring</li>
<li>Amplifying and Deamplifying words - words like ‘very’ which make an emotion more intense or ‘barely’ which make an emotion less intense.</li>
<li>Negators - words like ‘not’ which would flip the sentiment</li>
</ul>
<p>For these lists I will get the data used in the <code>sentometrics</code> <a href="https://github.com/SentometricsResearch/sentometrics">package</a>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>load(url(&quot;https://github.com/SentometricsResearch/sentometrics/blob/master/data-raw/FEEL_eng_tr.rda?raw=true&quot;))
load(url(&quot;https://github.com/SentometricsResearch/sentometrics/blob/master/data-raw/valence-raw/valShifters.rda?raw=true&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>and break them up into separate vectors of words:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>polarity_terms &lt;- FEEL_eng_tr %&gt;% transmute(term = x, polarity = y)
polarity_negators &lt;- valShifters$valence_en %&gt;% filter(t==1) %&gt;% pull(x) %&gt;% str_replace_all(&quot;&#39;&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
polarity_amplifiers &lt;- valShifters$valence_en %&gt;% filter(t==2) %&gt;% pull(x) %&gt;% str_replace_all(&quot;&#39;&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
polarity_deamplifiers &lt;- valShifters$valence_en %&gt;% filter(t==3) %&gt;% pull(x) %&gt;% str_replace_all(&quot;&#39;&quot;,&quot;&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, I can use <code>udpipe</code>’s <code>txt_sentiment</code> function to use these lists to score my annotated data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sentiments &lt;- txt_sentiment(annotated_reviews, term = &quot;lemma&quot;, 
                            polarity_terms = polarity_terms,
                            polarity_negators = polarity_negators, 
                            polarity_amplifiers = polarity_amplifiers,
                            polarity_deamplifiers = polarity_deamplifiers)
sentiments &lt;- sentiments$data</code></pre>
<p>In addition to the initial annotations there are now columns for polarity (just the positive / negative based on the term) and sentiment_polarity which incorporates the additional information.</p>
<p>Now that there are sentiments I’m going to want to find the words that those negative terms modify using <code>cbind_dependencies()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>reasons &lt;- sentiments %&gt;%
  #Attached Parent Words to Data
  cbind_dependencies() %&gt;%
  #Filter Columns
  select(doc_id, lemma, token, upos, polarity, sentiment_polarity, token_parent, lemma_parent, upos_parent, dep_rel) %&gt;%
  #Keep Only Terms with Negative Sentiment
  filter(sentiment_polarity &lt; 0)</code></pre>
<p>The revised data now looks like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(reasons) %&gt;% knitr::kable()</code></pre>

<p>A quick look at the data calls out a problem that exists with all dictionary based approaches which is that there is a context that the analyst knows that a dictionary cannot. For example, the term above “less data” is taken to be a negative because having “less data” would be bad… except in the context of Instagram Lite <strong>using</strong> “less data” would actually be good.</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of why we’re seeing negative sentiment I will construct a network graph between the negative term and the thing they are modifying and looking for the common phrases.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Keep only dependency relationships that are adjectival modifiers 
# (terms that modify a noun / pronoun)

# Create the Nodes as either the term in the dictionary or a word linked

                                   &quot;linked-to&quot;)),
  data_frame(key = unique(setdiff(reasons$lemma_parent, reasons$lemma))) %&gt;%

In the network we see the “less data” as the strongest co-occurrence even thought it (and many other words in this group) are not strictly negative words. Some of these connections make sense to be negative like “slow speed” or “useless app” which seems unquestionably bad. But some of these don’t make sense to me like “full screen” being bad. Although looking at a few of the sample reviews that say full screen they are usually in reference to full screen modes not working. So while it does appear that the sentiment model is capturing that “full screen” is discussed as a negative thing, the graph view above does not make that clear.</p>
<p>So dependency parsing for sentiment analysis seems like a cool idea but is a bit “your mileage may vary”.</p>

<h3>Word Clouds on Keywords</h3>
<p>The last text analysis technique for this post will probably be the most well known… wordclouds. It will show what are the most common words in our data set and can be used to understand the set of reviews at a quick glance. But rather than relying on most common words, I’ll use the <code>textrank</code> package to extract relevant keywords text where keywords are defined as combinations of words following each other. To try to get the most relevant set of keywords, I will be limiting to nouns, adjective, and verbs and will create a wordcloud of the top 30.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>textrank_keywords(annotated_reviews$lemma,
                  relevant = annotated_reviews$upos %in% c(&#39;NOUN&#39;, &#39;ADJ&#39;, &#39;VERB&#39;)) %&gt;% 
  .$keywords %&gt;% filter(ngram &gt; 1 &amp; freq &gt; 1, !str_detect(keyword, &#39;be&#39;)) %&gt;%
  slice_max(freq, n = 50) %&gt;% 
  with(wordcloud(keyword, freq, max.words = 50, colors = brewer.pal(10, &#39;Dark2&#39;)))</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/word_cloud-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>So what are people saying about IG Lite…. that they want dark mode, they want music stickers and that its a good app.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="conclusions" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>In this post I leveraged the Google Play Reviews that were scraped back in April to analyze the ratings and the review text using some of less well-known NLP packages (at least in my opinion) to do modified versions of Topic Modeling with Biterm Models, modified versions of sentiment analysis with dependency parsing, and a modified version of a word cloud using keyword extraction.</p>
<p>As far as answering the questions about what are people saying about IG Lite. It seems really mixed. In terms of star ratings things appeared to start very rough in Jan / Feb but had improved through March and April. From the topic models, some people like that its less resource intense than “Instagram Heavy” while others find it buggy and lacking features. From the sentiment analysis, this polarized view can be summed up in the nodes that formed “Good App”, “Good Enough”, and “Useless App” such that there’s no dominant sentiment.</p>
<p>Except Dark Mode… give the people dark mode.</p>
