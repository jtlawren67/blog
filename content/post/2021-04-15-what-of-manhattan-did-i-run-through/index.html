<p>In a <a href="/2021/04/01/heatmapping-my-new-york-city-marathon-training/">previous post</a> I created a cool-looking (in my opinion) heatmap of my Marathon training from years back. One of the downsides to that density-based method of making the heat map was that routes I only ran once didn’t show up very clearly. I also wanted to know roughly what % of Manhattan I covered in my runs. This post will use that same data to create a choropleth map by Census Tract to both visualize all the tracts I passed through in my training as well as determine what % of Manhattan’s land area did I cover.</p>
<div id="libraries-used" class="section level2">
<h2>Libraries Used</h2>
<p>The packages used in this analysis are the same from the prior analysis, <code>Tidyverse</code> for data manipulation, <code>sf</code> for modifying spatial data, <code>tigris</code> for getting the basemaps to plot my routes and <code>extrafont</code> to bring in new fonts for the plots.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse) # Data Manipulation
library(sf) # Manipulation Spatial Data
library(tigris) # Getting Tract and Roads Spatial Data
library(extrafont) # Better Fonts For GGPLOT</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="data-used" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Used</h2>
<p>The data is also the same running route data from the prior post. For more details on its creation please reference the <a href="/2021/04/01/heatmapping-my-new-york-city-marathon-training/">prior post</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>runs_and_routes &lt;- readRDS(&#39;data/runs_and_routes.RDS&#39;)
all_routes &lt;- readRDS(&#39;data/all_routes.RDS&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>For the basemap I’m again using the <code>tigris</code> package however this time getting census tracts rather than roads. According to the package, <em>Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people</em>. The map is downloaded using the <code>tracts()</code> function with inputs for state and county.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nyc_tracts &lt;- tracts(&quot;NY&quot;, &quot;New York&quot;, cb = T) %&gt;% 
  st_transform(crs = st_crs(runs_and_routes$geometry))</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot() + geom_sf(data = nyc_tracts) + ggthemes::theme_map()</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/map1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Unlike the <a href="/2021/04/01/heatmapping-my-new-york-city-marathon-training/">prior analysis</a> where the heatmap was just overlaid atop the map, here I need to identify which census tracts contained a route I ran vs. which didn’t. This can be done using the <code>st_join</code> function, specifying it to be a left join, and specifying the join type as <code>st_intersects</code> which joins the route information if the lat/long is contained in the census tract. The data is then grouped by tract_name and some other tract metadata. Then I create a field for number of route which will be used for the choropleth.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Join Routes to Tracts by Intersecting
nyc_geo_join &lt;- nyc_tracts %&gt;% 
  st_join(all_routes %&gt;% distinct(route_id, geometry),
          join = st_intersects,
          left = T
          ) %&gt;% 
  group_by(
    TRACTCE, #Census Tract ID
    ALAND, #Land Area
    AWATER #Water Area
  ) %&gt;% 
  summarize(num_routes = n_distinct(route_id, na.rm = T), .groups = &#39;drop&#39;) %&gt;% 
  #Set 0 Routes to NA colored
  mutate(num_routes = if_else(num_routes == 0, NA_integer_, num_routes))</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="visualization" class="section level2">
<h2>Visualization</h2>
<p>The choropleth provides an alternative version to the heatmap which will better show each census tract that <strong>at least one</strong> of my routes had passed through. Really rare routes did not show up on the heatmap, but they will be clearer here.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = nyc_geo_join, 
          aes(fill = num_routes)) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(na.value = &quot;grey90&quot;, guide = F) + 
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-74.15, -73.8)) + 
  labs(title = paste0(&quot;Census Tracts I&#39;ve &quot;,emo::ji(&#39;running&#39;),&quot; Through&quot;),
       fill = &quot;# of Routes Run&quot;,
       caption = &quot;**Author:** JLaw&quot;) + 
  ggthemes::theme_map() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, family = &#39;Arial Narrow&#39;, hjust = .5),
    plot.caption = ggtext::element_markdown(),
    plot.caption.position = &#39;plot&#39;
  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/cloropleth-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now the East Side routes are clearer.</p>

<h2>What % of Manhattan Did I Run Through?</h2>
<p>The island of Manhattan covers 22.7 square miles. I was curious what % of square miles I covered based on census tracts. While this will seriously over-count my distance covered it is easy to calculate. If I ran through the tract I get to count 100% of its land area. If I did not, I count nothing.</p>
<p>The <code>ALAND</code> columns from the Census Tract data contains the land area in square kilometers <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/note/US/LND110210">which I convert to square miles</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_summary &lt;- nyc_geo_join %&gt;%
  as_tibble %&gt;% 
  mutate(covered = !is.na(num_routes)) %&gt;% 
  group_by(covered) %&gt;% 
  summarize(tracts = n(),
            #Convert Square KM to Square Miles
            area = sum(ALAND)/2589988) %&gt;%
  mutate(pct_tracts = tracts / sum(tracts),
         pct_area = area/sum(area))</code></pre>
<p>During this marathon training, I ran through 101 of Manhattan’s 288 Census Tracts (35%) and passed through census tract’s covering 8.7 <em>mi^2</em> out of 22.7 <em>mi^2</em> for <strong>38.4%</strong>.</p>
