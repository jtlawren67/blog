Harikrishnan,3,2021-04-05,4787,"Its surely consumes less data than original app, but many of you may not get comfortable with this interface. One of the major problems I faced was that stories are getting replayed many times without me doing anything. The next major issue is that if you dont like a post it comes to your feed everytime over and over again until you like the post. Hope Instgram Team will find a solution to these problems"
Piyush AryaPrakash,1,2021-04-06,3655,It's good to see that they are providing a lite version. But it doesn't even work . It's better to use in chrome than downloading lite. What's the problem - The feeds never get refreshed . You just have to scroll down and when you click refresh still you see the same feeds. Doesn't support links . Lags too much . Too much annoying while using the messenger. Despite having a good internet connection it keeps laging saying something went wrong. It's too slow
Badri narayan,4,2021-04-24,40,Very nice app as it is lite so it is good consume less data have limited things but I don't understand you can watch reels in app but if someone send you reels it shows not supported in lite so it should be fixed and during dark mode the text we type is not visible fix this too and everything is good ü§ó
Deepa Joe,5,2021-04-23,12,It's good for teens and young for used but I don't know what happened to my account it doesn't work . I has send problem to instagram they is always leave the problem don't solve it . I like his app and few days it doesn't work properly so plz make a solution for it . I have given 5 star on it
AlameZone Tech,1,2021-04-06,1420,"I'm really excited for this Lite Version. But my Security is better than everything, i have already enabled two factor authentication on my account before using this version, but the time i was log into my account using this Version, my login details Password and Username was been successfully logged in without asking for That Two factor authentication Codes. You better Check that Issue of 2FA Bypass and fix it."
aenean,3,2021-04-24,528,"I'm happy that Instagram finally has the lite version. I've been waiting this for years. However, it still needs many improvements. A smoother UI, and I suppose the dark mode too. Keep it up. If FB lite version can do it, I'm sure you can too. üòÑ"
Liaqatali Nazari,3,2021-04-22,318,One of the most annoying issue that I have faced since using Instagram is it's video autoplay. It's a major problem for those who don't have enough access to internet. I hope Instagram time work on this issue
Shubh_07,1,2021-04-13,395,Its usually like i am using facebook lite. Just name and some thing changes nothing more. Lag problem. Not give permission to post a bunch of photos. Experience of using disappointed. Not a smooth run looks like free not provide sticker answers. Just hated this . I know its lite version but give us main function of real app .
nikhil nikhil,5,2021-04-17,92,"My phone is working on 2G network but it works very well , but there are some problems such as we can't upload videos, we can't answer any stickers, questions, polls, etc... and if we didn't like a post that post remain in the feed until we like it and also we can't see any live , if instagram try to solve this problems it will be the best app than now.But I always like instagram‚ô°."
TANMOY SEN,1,2021-04-20,1199,"Instagram Lite App Play Store will add three new options to the new update 1. ""Data Saver"", 2. ""Multiple Photos"", 3. ""Video Call and Voice Record "". We request you to give these three options very soon, then we Instagram Lite app users will be very, very happy. Thanks."
…≥i∆ô,4,2021-04-18,1353,"I love the smooth interface. So far, something that I've been waiting for from Instagram has finally come. Works well on my Nokia with Android 9 Pie. Tough there might still improvements. Also, please don't autoplay the video feed on timeline. Keep up the good work."
Mary Cris,4,2021-04-20,53,"The notification (bell) is already on the right top which is very good.My only problem is that,poll is not available in my IG story,and one more thing,my friend added me on their gc but why I can't enter, it says ""Error,something went wrong please try again later""even though my internet connection is good.Hope you will fix it."
Eymaan Mustafa,1,2021-04-17,536,Not smooth at all considering how little data is required to run it. Notifications' tab has to be refreshed either while using the app or when its closed. Lags as well. I opened a chat and the messages weren't showing up...even when they did they weren't completely loading

Anna D,2,2021-04-08,40,"Good for viewing news feed, but impossible to be used for loading own posts and other features from this social network are not working, isn't like Facebook lite, eventually instgram lite is only for listing and watching pages"
jia,3,2021-04-05,44,"it's good but u have to click on everything instead of swiping to get to the stories/chats + there's no dark mode like‚Äî?? really?, the good thing is that it doesn't take a HUGE space out of my tablet so that's good."

Zainab Zia,1,2021-04-22,0,Its loses too many features. And is complicated to use. So its better to download the real app.
Cem √ñzƒ±rmak,3,2021-03-23,2881,"It is good for most things people do on Instagram. However, I cannot access some of my group chats on DM and I don't know what the problem is. It says ""Something went wrong. Please try again later."". Also, I cannot vote for polls in stories or give an answer to the public questions and although it is the lite version of the original app, I think these should be included. After those fixes, it will be a great app."

Marvin Martin,4,2021-03-14,3843,"This Instagram Lite is absolutely great app. But it can't fully completed. My suggestions to Instagram is: 1. Please add stickers for free. 2. Extend Instagram photos into 20 photos, NOT 10 photos. 3. Please add video extension to 3 minutes only, NOT 1 minute video. 4. Less data for Instagram stories. 5. Make sure this Instagram Lite is really 70% less data, truly easy to messaging and posting, and full of happiness with stickers. Thank you."
Prasanth Ganesan,4,2021-03-31,226,This app is super cool and easy to use. Would be better if these minor improvements are made. 1. Unable to view more than 25 stories. Please add see more button if possible. 2. Deep linking is not working sometimes 3. Dark mode
Queenie Me√±oza,2,2021-03-24,937,"I hope you can fix the app itself :(( It's a great app but whenever I try to add some story or post a picture, it just kept on bugging. That's why I couldn't add some story or post a pic. I'm quite disappointed of how it works since the features of the IG lite is already satisfying for me, hope you can fix this :(("

Sai Krishna Murari,2,2021-02-04,3142,Things you need to fix- 1. New feed is not loading. 2. When we read a message it still shown as unread. And things you need to add- 1. You can't zoom in any photo in lite 2. You can't react to stories Since it is a lighter version I am ok with curret app except the above mentioned.If you fix these things it will be great.
Venki 0_0,2,2021-02-01,4057,"Hey! If ur a feed consumer, then go for it If ur into content creator, definitely not recommended! Difference:(what you cannot do in lite version) -no reels section -you cannot use it in night mode(if u use in night mode u can't see the logos in bottom and top like home, search, reels, heart, ur profile, dms, story etc... (-2star) -U can't make story (-1star) ... And much more"

Queena Marie,4,2021-03-03,3140,"4 stars because: - I can finally see fancy/special/aesthetic fonts using the lite version of Instagram. My phone itself couldn't read special fonts in any other app so this point is a big thumbs up! üëçüèª - works just as fine as the actual Instagram app, it's a bit laggy but I'm fine with it. üòò ‚ùóBUT‚ùó - the emojis used in the lite version is different from my phone's system emoji, causing me to see squares on some exclusive emojis. I hope this can be fixed! ü•∞ - dark mode please ü§£"

Sree Charan,1,2021-02-14,2703,"This app is pointless. When you can open this in browser, why build an app again? - Opening in Browser is much better. - Photos are cropped. - There is a bug while seeing ""more"" in the captions. - No stories - Doesn't open exact profile link or video link. Cannot watch a single video."

I also try to report this problem using an option of reporting this just belo the message but I doesn't work.I also try with InstaWeb but doesn't work. User,rahul.borana.1"
Sumit Saren,2,2021-02-13,1618,It's a great alternative of Instagram and the best part why I left the original to this lite version is because of no ads in lite and also because the feeds are not to addictive.However a lot of improvements are needed in this like specially the older post always stay on top so for newer post you have to scroll down which is to irritating also you cannot zoom on posts.But since it is newly launched I hope this gets fixed soon as this lite version looks better than the original.
Kuziva Mubonderi,1,2021-03-01,758,The app is the worst Instagram experience I've had it felt like I went back in time to 2017 but couldn't vote on stories etc. The app could have just had the same functionality as The original Instagram but it fell like a browser app that has less functionality. It horrible I wish I could give it 0 stars. Uninstalled

It has limitations that I consider as useless but please try by all means to fix these
Abhinav Vats,3,2021-04-03,5,It is good and I would have given more star but needed to be improved in the reels sector.

Aman Kesarwani,1,2021-02-12,934,Fix some issues and add features:- 1)) introduce dark(night) mode 2)) not preload igtv or reels videos (because it is lite app and we use lite apps because we want more in less data) 3)) Give data saver mode to loas images in very low quality 4)) Fix other issues of app stability.

Aditya Shekhar,5,2021-03-05,348,This is good if you want to get over from your addiction for instagram .. as it has less features it won't allow you to use this for longer periods. It was helpful for me atleast.
Joel Jeshurun,5,2021-03-03,62,"I want to thank the devs for this app. I have been trying to not use ig, so i deleted it but at times I just want to check some post and stories and I have been doing that through a browser instead, this app gives the browser experience for me and it is a good alternative if you are just looking to check out some things although I would not recommend you use it as a direct alternative to the original as the features in the original are much better. Nevertheless, it served my purpose of use!"

And why does every single action require a loading bar before it opens, even switching tabs?! This is certainly not a lighter version. This is an outdated website within an app container. I was really hoping for a simpler version of Instagram with only the original features, and without Reels and all the other distractions added lately, but what you created here is a huge disappointment."
